# Retrieval Augmented Generation with a GGUF Model

This repository shows how to set up a RAG pipeline using a custom GGUF model, downloaded from HuggingFace
Along with LangChain, Chroma for vector storage and streamlit for a chatbot interface. 

In building this, I have closely followed the structure [here](https://medium.com/@vipra_singh/building-llm-applications-open-source-chatbots-part-7-1ca9c3653175), but I am using a different model, and some parts of my script are different. This just to show that the original structure can be easily extended. 

 **Note:** This project is a demonstration. Some components (such as ingestion performance and retrieval accuracy) may require further optimization.
